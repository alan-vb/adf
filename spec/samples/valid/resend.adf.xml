<!--
	this sample required application/object validation logic because
	it's valid, but only because the prospect status == 'resend'

	'resend' can simply update the requestdate of a lead and not 
	pass along the rest of the required data

	anyone know XSD/DTD well enough to know if you can handle 
	this kindof a conditional?
