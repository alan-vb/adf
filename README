== ADF

ADF is a Ruby library for creating and parsing Auto-lead Data Format (ADF)

ADF is an industry standard data format for the export and import of 
automotive customer leads using XML

More information about the ADF format can be found at:
wikipedia:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-lead_Data_Format
dealerapex:: http://adf.dealerapex.com
specification:: http://adf.dealerapex.com/ADFVersion1.pdf

In our documentation and code, ADF may refer to both this library and the ADF format. 
When it's not clear which we're referring to, we'll use 'ADF format' or 'ADF library' 
to be clear.
